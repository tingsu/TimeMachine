TimeMachine is an automated testing tool for Android apps,  which can automatically jump to the most progressive state observed in the past when progress is slow.

TimeMachine leverages virtualization technology such as emulator to save an app state and restore it when needed. TimeMachine identifies an app state with GUI layout and memories all discovered states. When a state is considered interesting, e.g., new code is covered, TimeMachine saves the state. Meanwhile, TimeMachine observes most-recently-visited states to check whether progress is slow, e.g., being stuck in a state loop. Once progress is considered slow, TimeMachine restores the most progressive one from saved states for further exploration so that more program behavior is exercised in a short time. 

    


<!---
The figure above demonstrates how it works. When execution keeps going through a loop state S2 -- S3 -- S4 -- S2 (see Figure (a)), TimeMachine terminates the current execution due to lack of progress, resumes the most progressive state S1 (assuming that S1 is the most progressive state among all discovered states),  and launches a new execution from state S1. When reaching state S6 via S5 (see Figure(b)), the execution gets stuck, i.e., unable to exit the state after executing a fixed amount of events. TimeMachine terminates current execution again and resumes the most progressive state S5 to launch a new execution. The whole process is automatically triggered during testing.

## Architecture ##
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/DroidTest/TimeMachine/blob/master/arch.jpg" width="600">
</p>

The figure above shows TimeMachine's architecture. The whole system runs in a docker container with the Ubuntu operating system. App under test is installed in an Android virtual machine. TimeMachine connects the virtual machine via ADB to test the app. Main Components are configured as followed:

* Android SDK Version 25  
* Android-x86-7.1.r2
* Virtualbox 5.1.38 or 5.0.18 
* Docker API v1.13 or above 
* Python 2.7.2

## Todo ##
Ubuntu version needs to be specified in the current setting, Ubuntu 18.04 for now. <br>
Develop a module to dynamically identify versions of the operation system for image building.
## Setup ##
The following is required to set up TimeMachine:
* at least 100 GB hard drive 
* 8 GB memory
* Ububntu 18.04 64-bit

### Step 1: clone repository ###
```
git clone https://github.com/DroidTest/TimeMachine.git
```
### Step 2: install dependencies ###

install and configure docker 
```
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker 
```

### step 3: build an docker image ###
```
docker build -t droidtest/timemachine:1.0 .
```
It takes serveral minutes.
**Note:** you should build the docker image whenever your running Linux kernel has been changed(e.g. kernel updated).
## Usage ##
TimeMachine takes as input apks instrumented with Android apps instrumenting tool [Emma](http://emma.sourceforge.net/) or [Ella](https://github.com/saswatanand/ella). Under folder two_apps_under_test are closed-source apks instrumented with Ella, i.e., Microsoft Word and Duolingo.  
```
cd fuzzingandroid
```
Test example apps in a container   
```
#USAGE: exec-single.bash APP_DIR OPEN_SOURCE DOCKER_IMAGE TIMEOUT [OUTPUT_PATH]

./exec-single-app.bash ../two_apps_under_test/ms_word/ 0 droidtest/timemachine:1.0 1800 ../word_output
./exec-single-app.bash ../two_apps_under_test/duolingo/ 0 droidtest/timemachine:1.0 1800 ../duolingo_output
```  

## Output ##
check method coverage
```
./compute_cov_aver.bash ../word_output/ ../two_apps_under_test/ms_word/
./compute_cov_aver.bash ../duolingo_output/ ../two_apps_under_test/duolingo/
```
check crashes
```
cat word_output/timemachine-output/crashes.log
cat duolingo_output/timemachine-output/crashes.log 
```
## Need help? ##
* If failed to connect VM, please check whether virtualbox is correctly installed. TimeMachine was tested on virtualbox 5.0.18 and virtualbox 5.1.38. 
* Contact Zhen Dong for further issues.
